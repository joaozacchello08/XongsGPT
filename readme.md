# How can i run it myself?
1. You must have installed: [Node](https://nodejs.org), [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Bun](https://bun.sh).
2. You need to redeem your API key on https://aistudio.google.com/apikey, it's very easy and intuitive, save the key somewhere temporarily.
3. With the API key stored, you need to clone this repository, just go to your projects folder on CMD (```cd projects```) and ```git clone```.
4. On the root of this repository clone, you need to create a file named ".env" and write "VITE_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE".
5. run the commands: ```bun install && bun dev```.
6. Open your application running on http://localhost:5173/
